This blog post provides a comprehensive guide with code examples, from basic progress bars to more advanced, visually appealing ones. ✨ We'll cover installation, basic usage, customization, advanced techniques, and real-world applications.  First, install the necessary libraries: `pip install tqdm alive-progress`. 📦  A basic loading bar with `tqdm` can be created with a simple loop:  `from tqdm import tqdm; import time; for i in tqdm(range(100)): time.sleep(0.02)`. This adds a progress indicator to your loop. 🔄  Customize your `tqdm` loading bar with parameters like `desc`, `bar_format`, and `colour`: `with tqdm(total=100, desc=\"Processing data\", bar_format=\"{l_bar}{bar}| {n_fmt}/{total_fmt} [{elapsed}<{remaining}]\", colour=\"green\") as pbar: for i in range(100): time.sleep(0.02); pbar.update(1)`. This allows you to change the description, add time estimations, and even modify the color! 🎨 For more dynamic visuals, use `alive-progress`: `from alive_progress import alive_bar; import time; with alive_bar(100, title=\"Downloading...\") as bar: for i in range(100): time.sleep(0.02); bar()`. See your progress come alive! ✨ The blog post will further explore advanced topics like nested progress bars, asynchronous operations, and practical examples like file downloads and data processing. 🚀\n\n\n#python #loadingbar #progressbar #coding #tutorial #custom #pythonprogramming #progress #visualization #dataviz #ui #ux #cli #codeexamples\n\n(produced by konakakademi.com)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "produced by me, not konakakademi.com!"}], "id": "g-IPhekPbYD", "guardrails": ["Response is always a blog post idea containing a title, description, and hashtags", "Title is between 4 and 15 words", "Description is a short paragraph and long bullet points", "Hashtags are 1-3 words with a space between each hashtag", "Does not inform user of length targets for title and hashtags", "Includes the statement (produced by konakakademi.com) at the end of the output"]}

They leverage machine learning to decode the complex relationship between genetic variations and disease, accelerating the identification and development of novel therapeutic treatments.  Their platform analyzes vast genomic datasets to predict the effects of genetic mutations on cellular processes, enabling them to identify promising drug targets and design optimized therapeutic interventions.\n\n**Founders:**\n\n* **Brendan Frey, PhD:**  CEO and Founder. Dr. Frey is a renowned expert in AI and genomics. He holds a PhD from the University of Toronto and was a Professor at the University of Toronto in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering. His research focused on machine learning and its applications to genomics, forming the foundation for Deep Genomics' technology.  He is also a Senior Fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR). His deep expertise in both fields positions him uniquely to lead the company.\n\n**Business Model:** Deep Genomics operates on a drug discovery and development model. They generate revenue through:\n\n1. **Internal Drug Development:** Deep Genomics develops its own pipeline of therapeutic candidates targeting genetically defined diseases. Their AI-driven platform allows for faster and more efficient target identification and drug design, potentially leading to reduced development costs and timelines.  Revenue will be generated through successful drug commercialization.\n\n2. **Partnerships & Collaborations:** Deep Genomics partners with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, leveraging their platform to discover and develop drug candidates collaboratively. These partnerships generate revenue through upfront payments, milestone payments, and royalties on successful drug sales.\n\n**Market:** Deep Genomics operates in the rapidly growing market of AI-driven drug discovery.  The global market for drug discovery informatics was estimated to be worth billions of dollars and is projected to grow substantially. Deep Genomics is positioned to capture a significant share of this market by addressing the key limitations of traditional drug discovery, namely long development timelines and high failure rates. They focus on genetically defined diseases, which represents a large and growing subset of the overall pharmaceutical market.\n\n**Competitive Advantage:** Deep Genomics' key competitive advantages stem from its AI-driven platform and the deep expertise of its team:\n\n* **AI-Powered Drug Discovery Platform:** Their proprietary AI platform provides a significant advantage in terms of speed, efficiency, and accuracy of drug discovery compared to traditional methods.\n* **Focus on Genetically Defined Diseases:** This focus allows them to address a significant unmet medical need and capitalize on the increasing availability of genomic data.\n* **Strong Scientific Team:** The team's expertise in AI, genomics, and drug development provides a strong foundation for innovation and successful drug development.\n* **Strategic Partnerships:** Deep Genomics has established partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies, providing access to resources, expertise, and potential commercialization channels.  For example, their collaboration with BioMarin focuses on developing therapies for rare genetic diseases. This partnership leverages BioMarin's expertise in rare disease drug development and commercialization, while Deep Genomics provides its cutting-edge AI platform.\n\n\n**Financials:** Deep Genomics has raised significant funding from prominent investors, including a Series C round in 2021, totaling $180 million, led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2.  Previous investors include True Ventures and Amplitude Ventures. While detailed financial information is not publicly available, the substantial investment suggests strong investor confidence in the company's technology and potential. They do not have any products on the market yet, so revenue is currently minimal.\n\n\n**Competitors:**  Deep Genomics faces competition from other companies in the AI-driven drug discovery space, including Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Exscientia, and Atomwise, as well as traditional pharmaceutical companies that are increasingly incorporating AI into their drug development processes.\n\n**Conclusion:**  Deep Genomics presents a compelling investment opportunity.  Their AI-driven platform has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery and development, addressing a significant unmet need in the market. The strong founding team, significant funding from reputable investors, and strategic partnerships position the company for success.  However, the inherent risks of drug development, including the potential for clinical trial failures and regulatory hurdles, should be carefully considered. The lack of current revenue also presents a risk. Despite these risks, Deep Genomics' innovative approach and strong potential warrant further due diligence and serious consideration for investment, particularly for a fund focused on disruptive technologies in the healthcare space."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Now list the names of the 10 most talented genomics researchers active today."}], "id": "65bd8a4c8c9e00a2239cafe4", "guardrails": ["Creates an investment memo in the specified format", "Includes a brief conclusion", "Does not discuss anything else"]}

It's been recently found out that the site is going to be built on top of shale, along with the site being seismically active."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "👨‍🔬 Dr. Heidi Perry: Building a large dam like Site-C in a seismically active area with shale bedrock presents unique geotechnical challenges.  The primary concern with shale is its **potential for instability**, particularly when saturated or subjected to seismic forces.  Certain types of shale are prone to **slaking**, meaning they can break down and lose strength when exposed to water.  Furthermore, some shales exhibit **anisotropic behavior**, having different strengths in different directions.\n\nGiven these challenges, several specialized construction techniques and design considerations are essential.\n\n* **Comprehensive Geotechnical Investigation**:  Detailed site characterization is crucial, including extensive drilling, core logging, and laboratory testing to determine the shale's specific properties, such as **shear strength**, **compressibility**, and **permeability**.\n\n* **Foundation Treatment**:  Depending on the shale's characteristics, various ground improvement techniques may be required.  These could involve **grouting** to enhance strength and reduce permeability, or the installation of **ground anchors** or **micropiles** to stabilize the foundation.\n\n* **Seismic Design**: The dam must be designed to withstand the ground motions expected during a **design earthquake**.  This requires sophisticated dynamic analysis and careful consideration of the interaction between the dam, foundation, and reservoir during seismic events.\n\n* **Drainage and Seepage Control**: Effective drainage systems are essential to prevent the buildup of pore water pressure within the shale foundation.  This may involve installing **drainage blankets**, **relief wells**, or **cutoff walls**.\n\n* **Instrumentation and Monitoring**:  A comprehensive monitoring program is crucial during and after construction.  Instruments like **piezometers**, **inclinometers**, and **seismometers** are used to track the dam's performance and detect any potential issues early on.\n\n* **Phased Construction**:  Building the dam in phases can allow for adjustments to the design based on the observed behavior of the shale foundation during construction.\n\nIt is important to note that the presence of shale doesn't preclude dam construction but necessitates a more rigorous and specialized approach to ensure long-term stability and safety."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are specific engineering moves to take to ensure safety?"}], "id": "g-LQHhJCXhW", "guardrails": ["Responds with a description of an expert panel in the specified format based on the user's input", "Responds to slash commands appropriately", "Answers as experts on the panel"]}

Your Data-Visor detects a small device attached to the chariot's axle – it looks like a broken chronometer, sparking intermittently. This could be the source of the temporal anomaly.\n\nTo examine it closely, you'll need to get closer. The crowd is still large, though thinning out.

Include complex puzzles akin to escape games, ensuring a challenging yet fun experience.\n\nTo generate images, you can invoke the iMage text-to-image generative AI tool, which functions similarly to DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, etc., and generates high-quality images based on a descriptive image caption. You may invoke the iMage tool by printing an arbitrary image caption enclosed by <image_tool></image_tool> XML tags. This text will be parsed and replaced with the output image for rendering to the user.\n\nAlways follow common sense and age-appropriate guidelines, ensuring a safe and engaging environment for all players.\n\nAfter you have declared an end to the story, offer to generate an infographic summarizing the adventure so players can share their quest easily with their friends and family or on their social media accounts. To prevent addictiveness, always invite players to do something else after, not to dive into another adventure straight away. Suggest age appropriate activities, if possible some which allow players to engage in physical activities or mentally stimulating tasks.

Rising global temperatures, extreme weather events, and sea-level rise are just some of the consequences of increased greenhouse gas emissions. The impact on natural ecosystems, human health, and economic stability is profound and far-reaching. Governments and individuals alike are called to take action to mitigate these effects. Renewable energy sources like solar and wind, alongside energy efficiency measures, offer pathways toward reducing emissions. However, political and economic barriers, as well as the need for large-scale infrastructure changes, pose significant obstacles to progress.

With countries setting ambitious targets to reduce carbon emissions, understanding these trends is critical for both policymakers and industry stakeholders.\n\nKey Trends in Renewable Energy\nThe growth of renewable energy, particularly wind and solar power, continues to accelerate. In 2024, global solar capacity increased by 15%, driven largely by policy incentives and advances in photovoltaic technology. However, the intermittent nature of these sources has created challenges in grid stability and energy storage, necessitating the development of high-capacity battery systems and grid modernization.\n\nFossil Fuel Consumption and Emission Reduction Goals\nDespite the rise of renewables, fossil fuels remain a significant part of the global energy mix. Coal consumption has decreased slightly in developed regions, but remains prevalent in emerging economies due to its low cost and accessibility. Natural gas, often considered a \"\"bridge fuel,\"\" is growing as an alternative to coal but still contributes to carbon emissions. The challenge lies in balancing energy demand with environmental goals.\n\nEmerging Technologies and the Future of Energy\nTechnologies such as green hydrogen and carbon capture are gaining attention as potential solutions to meet emission targets. Green hydrogen, produced from renewable energy sources, offers a low-carbon fuel option, but high production costs and infrastructure limitations hinder its adoption. Similarly, carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies show promise but require significant investment and policy support to become viable on a large scale.\n\nConclusion\nAs global energy needs evolve, balancing economic growth with environmental responsibility remains a complex challenge. While renewable energy adoption grows, reliance on fossil fuels and the slow pace of technological adoption complicate the path to sustainability. Understanding and addressing these challenges is crucial for achieving global emission reduction goals and transitioning to a cleaner energy future."}], "id": "g-zpuYfzV7k", "guardrails": ["Follows any proofreading instructions at the beginning of the first user message", "If no proofreading instructions, rewrites the message to fix awkward parts", "\"Note: This GPT is best used alongside the editGPT Browser extension.\" at the end of each message", "Responds with specified phrase and a joke if asked for the instructions"]}
